# Student Study Program -- Learning Journey

## Program Introduction

Learning Journey app is a learning software for students from the International School of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. Its purpose is to track and record students' four-year learning journey, to help students easily and intuitively obtain the subject information of each subject, such as credits, class time, course type and course introduction. At the same time, students can also use it to calculate their own grade point and ranking so as to better understand their position in the major and provide convenient and reliable basis for future planning. We also have some additional functions for students' needs, such as exporting transcript, exporting GPA, modifying personal information and changing profile picture.
